        <h2 style="text-align:center">Ribbon Bakes a Cake.</h2>
        <p>The Fortune office was uncannily quiet. Not for a lack of people &ndash; if anything, the full medical bay meant there were more people present than usual at any one time. The problem was, of course, that very same full medical bay. Even with the worst of the injured coming to, there was a sombre mood hanging over them all. As of late, it seemed, all their outings had been some dreadful affair. The massive forgotten, the sudden fracture, Adeline&rsquo;s requiem, and now their resounding defeat at the hands of Amarov. It was an ample supply of events to weigh upon the heart, and with everyone worn out it made it hard to cling to joy.</p>
<p>Ribbon was restless. They didn&rsquo;t have the skills needed to reliably help Charlotte in her tending of the injured, and they were hardly in a position to be taking jobs that could keep them busy. Adeline and Thistle had each other to lean on, but Francelle was still at a point where she was spending more time than not unconscious. Miguel and Malcom were busying themselves with the various day-to-day tasks of running the office that they were suddenly short-handed on. They had to do something, but there was nothing to <em>do</em>, which was absolutely the worst part of it all.</p>
<p>It left them aimlessly pacing back and forth about the foyer of the office. The lockers were full of other peoples&rsquo; things, the table was a table, the computer was locked, none of it changed, no matter how many times they looped around. It was fitting perhaps, with their looping thoughts, but certainly not <em>helpful</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you trying to make yourself sick there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ribbon stopped so abruptly that they almost skidded on their heels. Thistle and Adeline were standing just inside the front door, shopping bags in hand, both looking at Ribbon. Adeline, if anything, looked somewhat worried, but Thistle stood calmly with eyebrows raised</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, why would I want to be <em>sick</em>?&rdquo; Ribbon replied. They crossed their arms and puffed out their chest with a defiant little stomp. It was a ludicrous suggestion, the last thing Charlotte needed was <em>another</em> person to care for.</p>
<p>Thistle&rsquo;s raised eyebrows shifted into a sly grin as Ribbon unknowingly gave her the exact reply she had been hoping for. &ldquo;Well, you know, with how much you were going around in circles there, I figured maybe you were trying to make yourself throw up so you could stay in the infirmary with Francell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was, um&hellip;&rdquo; They didn&rsquo;t want to admit to whatever it was they were doing, partly because they weren&rsquo;t entirely sure themselves. An out was needed, a masterful one at that. &ldquo;What were <em>you</em> doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perfect as always.</p>
<p>Thistle rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Um, <em>shopping</em>, duh.&rdquo; She jostled the bag of groceries she was carrying to drive her point home. With that, she closed the front door and headed to the kitchen, dropping the bag on the desk with an unceremonious <em>thunk </em>and an uncomfortable <em>crunch</em>.</p>
<p>Adeline winced. &ldquo;Thistle, the eggs are in there!&rdquo;<br /><br /> &ldquo;Oh, right. Well, we&rsquo;re gonna break them anyway, I just saved us some time, is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t work like that,&rdquo; Ribbon said. Even they, with as little experience in the kitchen as they had, knew that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah? Why don&rsquo;t you show us how to do it then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A <em>challenge</em>. A challenge that was perhaps a bit too vague, but there wasn&rsquo;t room enough in Ribbon&rsquo;s heart for such petty worries for all the major ones. They were standing next to Thistle before Adeline even had the chance to realise that this was possibly a bad idea. The groceries in the bag seemed fairly mundane &ndash; sugar, flour, baking powder, eggs, six single-serve tubs of strawberry yoghurt. Ribbon reached in and pulled out the carton of eggs. At first, it seemed fine, but once they flipped open the lid the toll of Thistle&rsquo;s reckless bag-handling became clear. Seven of the dozen were spilling out into the carton, and another two were perilously cracked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oops,&rdquo; was all Thistle had to say in defence of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thistle&hellip;&rdquo; Adeline said sadly as she walked over and saw the carnage. She placed her own bag of groceries next to Thistle&rsquo;s much more gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing?&rdquo; Ribbon asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were going to try making a cake for everyone,&rdquo; Adeline said.</p>
<p><em>Cake</em>. Ribbon knew cake. Not quite as well as pudding, perhaps, but it was roughly in the same category of food. There was sugar and milk involved at some point in the whole process. &ldquo;I can do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ribbon, you put the kettle in the microwave two days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, you heard them,&rdquo; Thistle said, &ldquo;they can do it. What goes in first, Ribbon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adeline continued to protest, but Ribbon didn&rsquo;t care. They looked about the assembled ingredients and racked their mind for all they knew of cake. It was soft, sweet, and spongy, and something that was baked. Eggs and strawberries both were involved at some point. With a heart suddenly full of confidence, they reached into Thistle&rsquo;s bag of groceries and pulled out the box of baking powder. It said &lsquo;baking&rsquo; on the box, it <em>had </em>to be important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh?&rdquo; was all Thistle had to add. They reached into the cupboards to pull out a large bowl, placing it down in front of Ribbon. &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They opened up the box and poured in a healthy amount. If it was important, surely the cake needed a lot of it. Adeline groaned, Thistle grinned. Next, well, seven of the eggs were already broken. They pulled the surviving eggs out of the carton and picked out most of the shells left inside, then dumped all the yolk and white that had spilled out into the carton into the bowl. There was far more egg than baking powder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s meant to be <em>flour</em> in there,&rdquo; Adeline said as she watched the horror unfolding before her.</p>
<p>Of course! Flour! Ribbon grabbed the bag and gently sprinkled it into the mix, leaving a slight dusting on top of the layer of eggs. Flour wasn&rsquo;t very tasty, though, so they didn&rsquo;t add much. What they did add plenty of was sugar, a good half the pack that had been in the freshly-bought groceries, leaving a glistening white mound in the middle of the bowl. It was far from a batter yet though, and Ribbon was running out of ingredients to add. They grabbed a spoon and began to stir it all into some horrific slurry, all grainy and eggy and not very cake-like at all. A piece of eggshell floated at the surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, we got some vanilla too, if you want to add some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A classic cake flavour. Not Ribbon&rsquo;s favourite on its own, but it paired very well with strawberry. They looked up from their creation back at Thistle and Adeline, feeling as though they had just broken out of some sort of haze. Adeline had her face buried in her hands, and Thistle was holding the bottle of vanilla extract out towards Ribbon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s it small?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <em>very </em>strong,&rdquo; Adeline groaned, looking at Ribbon with a pleading expression. Ribbon took the bottle and twisted off the cap, not quite believing her until the scent assailed their nostrils. It was far from the mellow sweetness they associated with vanilla, but something harsh and potent. They recoiled in disgust, thrusting the tiny bottle back at Thistle, who took it with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No vanilla then, got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ribbon chose not to deem Thistle and her stinky bottle worthy of a response and instead turn back to they hypothetical cake to ponder what else it was missing. Maybe it just needed to be cooked? They were fairly sure they knew how to use an oven, you twisted all the knobs and then put the food inside for an hour or two. Thistle yielded and Adeline protested as Ribbon made their way towards it with the mixing bowl, but as they were about to start spinning the knobs, the front door opened again.</p>
<p>Miguel couldn&rsquo;t glean much from just walking in the door, but what he could see and here was all he needed to know that it was <em>imperative</em> that he step in and stop whatever disaster was about to unfold. &ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; he called out as he bolted over, just in time to see Ribbon fiddling with the dial for the left back burner on the stove. &ldquo;What are you doing!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ribbon turned to look at Miguel, bowl in hand. &ldquo;Making a cake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miguel looked at the contents of the bowl. It was not cake batter. &ldquo;Did you look at a recipe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Adeline answered. &ldquo;Thistle encouraged this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aww, you&rsquo;re no fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miguel sighed and took the bowl from Ribbon, sclorping the slime within out into the sink. After a quick rinse, he placed it back on the desk and sorted through what was available. All the core ingredients were there at least, enough to make a simple sponge cake. &ldquo;You start with the flour,&rdquo; he explained as he began to put it all together. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the bulk of the cake, after all. The eggs are what bind the flour together, to make it more than just loose powder. Baking powder is what makes it rise &ndash; without it bubbles don&rsquo;t form as it bakes, and it ends up dense and unpleasant. Then the sugar, to make it sweet. Fold it all together as you go until it&rsquo;s smooth, if it&rsquo;s lumpy you&rsquo;ll find pockets of loose flour in the cake once it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ribbon and the ladies watched as Miguel put it all together with a deft hand, measuring out portions by eye as if it was the simplest thing in the world. Piece by piece, the batter came together, each individual ingredient steadily transforming the whole into something unlike any one part by themselves, and yet reliant on them all.</p>
<p>The thought churned in Ribbon&rsquo;s mind, somewhere closer to emotion than word. What role did they play, with the office not taking jobs for some time and Frankie bedridden? Thistle handed over the vanilla extract and Miguel added a few small drops as Adeline dug out a cakepan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Ribbon, pour this into the pan, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miguel waved them over, then handed over the bowl. It left him free to sidle over to the oven and turn it on. Ribbon stared blankly at the batter, so different than their own attempt. It even smelled better, despite how the vanilla extract had smelt in the bottle.</p>
<p>They poured the batter into the pan, as instructed.</p>
<p>A few minutes of preheating later, and the cake went in the oven. Soon, the office was filled with the sweet smell of baking, inescapable in the main foyer. Ribbon returned to their pacing as Addy and Thistle chattered and Miguel kept himself busy in the kitchen, until roughly an hour later he suddenly called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Ribbon, the cake should be cooled by now. Would you like to do the fun part?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one hand, he held a spatula. In the other, a tub of pre-made frosting. Fruits and dyes sat laid out on the counter in all sorts of colours, and suddenly the malaise heavy on Ribbon&rsquo;s chest shifted, giving way to a spark of excitement. There were <em>strawberries</em> there, ripe and juicy, and they could see in their mind&rsquo;s eye already just how to place them on the cake. Miguel showed them how to spread the frosting with the spatula, but quietly stood back to leave Ribbon to their devices. The cake, after all, may have been fine enough plain on its own, but it was this, the final step that could make it truly shine.</p>
