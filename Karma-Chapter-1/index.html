        <h2 style="text-align:center">Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>He was two and a half metres of sleek black metal. It was not shiny, but matte, almost like staring into a gaping void were it not for subtle purple details, an abyss from which no light could escape. In place of a face, was a smooth blank sheet on an almost catlike head. A heavy tail stretched out to counterbalance his weight as he hunched over, the claws on his feet scratching the cobblestones beneath him with every subtle shift. One arm rested on his thighs to help carry his weight, the other reached out before him. The fingers on his hands were as much weapons as his toes, honed to an inconceivably sharp edge. Every joint, every piston, was all carefully engineered with the sole purpose of causing harm as efficiently as possible and yet, held between the thumb and index of this mechanical monument to violence was a tiny blueberry muffin, offered gingerly.</p>
        <p>The woman in front of him was not terribly comforted by the offering, desperately pressing back into the wall behind her in an attempt to stay as far from those claws as possible. At the other end of the laneway, she caught a glimpse of police cars rushing by, lights and sirens blaring. The people who lived on the street were all sheltered in their homes, not even daring to look out the windows. Those who didn’t desperately banging on doors, begging for help they knew they would not get before machines much like the one before her caught up and began gutting any wearing the self-same uniform that she was. There was no hope of rescue from out there.</p>
        <p>“Hey, it’s okay,” the machine suddenly spoke. His voice was deep and mechanical, not one that any human could have without heavy augments. “I’m not with them, I promise. You were working for Andromeda, right?”</p>
        <p>“I’m not telling you <i>anything</i>, you monster,” she literally spat at him and the muffin he was holding. Noble her defiance may have been, she remained flat against the wall, her plain grey uniform a giveaway to the answer to his question.</p>
        <p>“See? I told them I shouldn’t do recruiting,” he mumbled, dropping his muffin-holding arm and letting the offering tumble to the ground. “How about we try from the top here? Hi! I don’t really have a name, but my allies call me Karma, since I’m a Karma Unit and all. As you may be able to tell, I’m somewhat defective, <i>and</i> your ticket to getting out of this mess alive, if you’ll let me.”</p>
        <p>“Why the <i>fuck</i> should I trust you?” The woman was glaring at him, but couldn’t stay calm enough to steady her breath or keep tears from welling up in the corner of her eyes.</p>
        <p>“Because, Johanka,” Karma said, leaning his face in close to hers as he says her name, “this is <i>your fault</i> and you know it. Maybe, if you live, your dreams of making a difference in this gods forsaken galaxy can amount to more than getting all your coworkers killed.”</p>
        <p>Being addressed by name caused Johanka to freeze. That she was wearing a name-tag was a forgotten detail in her panic-stricken mind. At the end of the laneway, she watched a woman she sometimes saw in the break room trip over a stray leg and promptly get smeared across the footpath by a blur of black. “They’ll find us,” she said, unable to rip her eyes from the sight, “I’m full of-”</p>
        <p>“Tracking bugs, I know, Andromeda classic,” Karma said nonplussed. “I give off a jamming signal, they would have come down here by now if I wasn’t here. If you come with me, we can get you somewhere safe to get rid of them.”</p>
        <p>“You’re lying.”</p>
        <p>“Maybe, but <i>they</i> certainly aren’t.” For the first time since he gave up on offering the muffin, Karma lifted his arms from his thighs, pointing out towards the chaos at the end of the laneway, where the other Karma Units were busy painting the advertisements that lined the street with viscera. Johanka took a breath through gritted teeth. Despite her best efforts to seem brave and tough, Karma was right. On her own, she stood no chance. Maybe this was some new trick being tried by Karmic Asset Protection, to try to bring people in alive, but even if that <i>were</i> the case then at least she would be alive to do something about it.</p>
        <p>Even still, she hesitated as she spoke. “How do you plan to get me out?”</p>
        <p>Karma carefully shuffled around, not fully rising out of his squat. His back was armoured much like the rest of him, but his intimidating build was made of stark edges rather than spikes. The invitation, though unspoken, was blindingly apparent. It took Johanka a moment to gird her courage, having to fight against a decade of learning to dread the approach of a Karma Unit. The pressure of an otherwise unavoidable death pushed her forwards, however, and soon she found herself doing the unthinkable act of willingly climbing onto a Karma Unit’s back.</p>
        <p>“Whatever you do, don’t let go,” Karma said before he rose from his squat. “My fingers are <i>very</i> sharp. I can’t catch you if you fall.”</p>
        <p>“Understood!” Johanka squeaked, unable to spare the effort to keep her voice steady. She thought she was holding on plenty tight, until Karma stood up beneath her and lifted her nearly a metre off the ground by sheer virtue of his size. Her fear of clinging onto a Karma Unit was suddenly overridden by something far more primal as she tightened her hold on his cold metal body.</p>
        <p>Karma himself turned back towards the wall Johanka had been cowering against as she solidified her grip. It was brick, underneath a layer of colourfully-worded graffiti and rain-weathered advertisements. A sturdy enough material to be sure, with little in the way of footholds. Before he began, he jostled himself in place, checking Johanka’s grip was firm. Satisfied, he raised a hand and   thrusted it into the wall. True to his warning that his fingers were sharp, they dug into the brick with ease.</p>
        <p>His other had was next, then a foot followed by the other. Bit by bit he hoisted himself up the solid wall, Johanka making a pointed effort to focus on staring at her apparent saviour’s nape rather than the growing distance between her and the ground. There had been times that she begrudged being assigned to a station on such a lightly developed planet, in a town where every building bar one was and identically boring three stories tall. Suddenly, that fact was a boon, and she wouldn’t trade it for all the glitz and glamour of the Plutocrats’ favourite party cities.</p>
        <p>The tiles on the roof crunched uncomfortably under Karma’s talons as he gathered his bearings. It was a comfortable middle class suburb, with usually quiet streets lined with identical apartments and the occasional corner shop. Ads for gadgets and holidays and all manner of other things littered every available surface, including the walls of the houses. Many were paper, but quite a few were electronic, whatever display they had been shilling prior replaced with a smiling face of a man with black and orange hair.</p>
        <p>“Hello civilians,” he said, voice piped through every available speaker. “I am Desiderius, owner of Karmic Asset Protection, and I care for your safety. Please stay inside while we take care of these dissidents.”</p>
        <p>“What a load of shit,” Karma mumbled. Many of the electronic posters displaying the recording were splattered with blood. Police cars were swarming the streets below, officers stationed at every door as the Karma units continued their gleeful hunt down the roads off towards his right. To his left loomed the local Andromeda Tower, a massive spire of glass and steel where almost all of the people in the suburb would have worked, and from where many were now fleeing. To Johanka, it seemed as though they had nowhere to run, with danger on every side.</p>
        <p>“Hold on,” was Karma’s only warning he gave before taking two great strides and leaping off the roof, right across the street onto the roof of the apartment on the other side. Johanka screamed. It was one thing to see a Karma Unit move like that, another thing entirely to experience it while clinging to one’s back. Not helping her shock in the least, when Karma <i>did</i> land, he shattered the shingles, one leg sinking through the roof.</p>
        <p>“<i>Shit</i>,” Karma mumbled. “I’m normally cooler than that, promise.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t really care about that right now!”</p>
        <p>“Yeah yeah,” Karma whinged as he yanked his leg free, sending bits of tile and wood scattering everywhere, “working on it.” From somewhere on the ground, a bullet whizzed by his shoulder. He muttered a flurry of obscenities as he scrambled to get moving again, long limbs flailing briefly as scampered across the roof as Johanka clung on for dear life.</p>
        <p>“Aren’t you guys meant to be sneaky!?”</p>
        <p>“You’re the one who screamed!”</p>
        <p>“You crashed through a roof!”</p>
        <p>“Not entirely!”</p>
        <p>Rooves however, must like good things, all come to an end – a fact which Karma was almost too caught up in petty debate to remember. He came skidding to a halt as he noticed just barely in time, flipping around like a startled cat to grab at the shingles in a desperate attempt to catch himself. Bits of terracotta dust kicked up into Johanka’s hair and face as he shattered yet more tiles. She spat and sputtered as some got into her mouth, not at all having expected almost anything that was happening to her in that moment.</p>
        <p>“Please tell me you at least know where you’re going,” Johanka said tiredly as she clung to Karma as he clung to the roof.</p>
        <p>“Of <i>course</i> I do!” Karma said hastily as he pulled himself back to his feet. “I just… might need to take a different route than I expected.”</p>
        <p>“You’re <i>terrible</i> at this.”</p>
        <p>“I’m saving your life!”</p>
        <p>“Then shut up and get moving!”</p>
        <p>Karma grumbled, but despite his disdain at Johanka’s commentary, he did still start to make a move. Hunching down, he readied himself to leap across the street to the roof on the other side once more so as to avoid the police on the ground. The motion elicited a groan from Johanka as she realised, but before the jump could be made, a black blur slammed down next to them.</p>
        <p>She was two metres of sleek black metal, deep and cold. She lacked a tail and the subtle cat-like features of Karma’s helmet, with her legs shaped like a person’s more than Karma’s bestial digitigrade ones. Rather than purple, her details were dark blue. Despite the differences, however, she was still undeniably a Karma Unit, and the claws on her hands she so kindly showed of were very, very lethal.</p>
        <p>“Well, well,” she said, voice as mechanical as Karma’s, “what’s this? I thought we were under very clear orders to kill the lot of them.”</p>
        <p>“I have, ah, special orders!” Karma said. “Straight from Desiderius!”</p>
        <p>The other Karma Unit stepped calmly forwards. “For you? I’ve never seen you before.”</p>
        <p>Johanka was doing her best to hide behind Karma, but her arms and hands remained exposed for her need to continue clinging to him. Her breath was catching in her chest, and her heart pounding. A prick of pain on the back of her hand elicited a sharp breath through her teeth. She could feel blood trickling down from where she was pricked.</p>
        <p>Karma grasped the other Karma Unit’s wrist before she could do any more than that. “I’m a very special Unit,” he said. “Most people never see me.”</p>
        <p>She yanked her hand free from Karma’s grasp, though he only offered a token amount of resistance – just enough that she had to use force to break free. “I am not <i>most people</i>,” she snapped, “I am <i>Abyss</i>.”</p>
        <p>“Abyss, Abyss…” Karma put a finger up to where his mouth would be if he had one, rocking his head side to side. “Ah, I know you! You’re that one who thinks she’s Desiderius’ favourite!”</p>
        <p>Abyss stomped her foot, shattering the tiles beneath and breaking a hole through the roof. “You have no idea how important I am!”</p>
        <p>Karma stepped back with a dismissive shrug. “Not important enough to know about me, clearly.”</p>
        <p>Abyss screamed and lunged forwards, the obvious move easily sidestepped by Karma. She staggered as she realised she had been dodged, but a swift kick in the back from Karma was enough to send her falling off the roof. Before she had even hit the ground, Karma had jumped off in the other direction and began sprinting down the street. He kept easy pace with the cars on the street, but his presence immediately drew the attention of the officers on the street. He raised one hand to the side of his head where an ear would be on a human as he sprinted.</p>
        <p>“Thao!” he called out. “I got spotted!”</p>
        <p>The various officers, meanwhile, stood about dumbfounded. He was quite clearly not acting in line with the operation, but what that meant for them, none of them could say, leaving them to resort to confused chatter.</p>
        <p>“What the hell, there’s a woman on that Karma Unit’s back?”</p>
        <p>“How did she get there?”</p>
        <p>“Stop gawking and stop them!” Abyss screeched as she picked herself up from her fall. She sprinted off after the pair without any care to see if the cops actually listened to her. A few gunshots rang out at her command, but with his speed and head start Karma was already little more than a speck down the street. Abyss was not deterred as she stampeded down the street after them. The pavement cracked and shattered beneath her feet, kicking up dust and debris in her wake.</p>
        <p>The sound of her approach was had to miss, even amongst the gunfire. Karma risked a glance over his shoulder as her steps drew ever closer, not at all comforted by her inexorable approach. With a flurry of expletives, he suddenly slowed with a screech as his feet ground against the pavement, all so he could take a corner. Rather than build up speed again once he was on the new street, he sidled up into the doorway of the first block of flats. Johanka started to speak, but Karma swiftly shushed her.</p>
        <p>But a second later, Abyss came around the corner, digging her claws into the corner of the building to fling herself around the corner without losing speed. The moment she passed the two of them, Karma hopped out of the doorway and bolted off down the street in the opposite direction.</p>
        <p>“Why can’t you turn like that!?” Johanka half-screamed over Karma’s thundering footsteps.</p>
        <p>“I <i>can!</i>” Karma snapped back. “<i>You</i> can’t!”</p>
        <p>Perhaps inadviseably, Johanka looked down. The pavement was rushing by beneath them <i>very</i> fast. She suddenly felt uncomfortably aware of every budding bruise and bubbling fatigue in her arms from clinging to Karma as he darted about ferrying her. Behind her, she could hear Abyss approaching once more – Karma’s trick had done little but buy them time.</p>
        <p>“She’s coming back!” Johanka shouted in a panic.</p>
        <p>“I know!” Karma did not look back to confirm, instead choosing to keep focused on moving forwards. “But I can only go so fast without killing you, I’m not built for saving people like this!”</p>
        <p>“You’re not going to be able to keep tricking her like that, she’ll catch on!”</p>
        <p>“We just need to buy a little more time!”</p>
        <p>“Time for what!?”</p>
        <p>“Just trust me!”</p>
        <p>Karma lifted one arm up in front of himself as he ran. As he held it steady, the metal plating covering it opened up and revealed the mechanical workings inside. The internal parts shifted and churned, reforming themselves until they popped out all at once up into the air. Karma caught it and pointed it behind him, taking potshots towards Abyss with the newly-formed gun. One of the shots struck her true in her right knee and she dramatically stumbled to the ground, flipping along the footpath several times before sliding to a stop. Karma took the opportunity to turn another corner while she was down, only to immediately have to jump over a police car driving at full speed down the street.</p>
        <p>The sudden jump was too much for Johanka, her tired arms finally losing their hold on Karma as he landed back on the ground. The car swerved to a stop behind the two, blocking off the street with its length. Johanka sat frozen and bloodied in the middle of the road, staring in horror as the door of the car flung open. All she could think to do in that moment was to close her eyes and await her end.</p>
        <p>“Quit lying around and get in!”</p>
        <p>If the surprisingly youthful voice calling out to her hadn’t snapped Johanka out of her moment of quiet acceptance, the gentle prod from Karma behind her would have. When she opened her eyes, she saw not a cop staring her down, but an oddly rabbit-like face, complete with black fur and fuzzy lop ears. The realisation that she was facing down another rescuer rather than a foe lit a fire under her, and she scrampered across the pavement and into the empty passenger seat. As she settled in, her saviour flipped a switch on the dash, and the door she entered through slammed shut on its own.</p>
        <p>“Right, hi, hello!” the driver said as they started to pull the car back into the street. “Was hoping to meet you in a better scenario, but this will do! Name’s Thao, former chauffeur, current getaway driver!”</p>
        <p>“N-nice to meet you!” Johanka replied. Whatever questions she had about their appearance could wait, she figured, until she was no longer in mortal danger. “Is Karma going to…?”</p>
        <p>“Don’t worry, he can keep up,” Thao said as they slammed the accelerator and the car lurched forwards. “He’s too heavy for most cars, anyway. All that metal really adds up, y’know?”</p>
        <p>As Thao said so, Karma caught up beside the car, giving Johanka a wave before dashing out ahead of the car to take a corner with the agility he had promised he had. Thao, for their part, barely slowed the car themself, causing Johanka to slam into the door.</p>
        <p>“Recommend you put your seatbelt on!” they said as Johanka recovered. She had no complaints with that suggestion, hastilly buckling herself in. Despite the wild turn, she saw Abyss rounding the corner behind them in the rear-view cameras.</p>
        <p>“Can you out-drive a Karma Unit?” Johanka asked nervously.</p>
        <p>“Shake her? No,” Thao said bluntly with a smile on their face. “But we don’t need to do that.”</p>
        <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
        <p>“K.A.P. doesn’t exactly like their assets going rogue,” they explained as they charged off down the street. “We just have to get outside the op zone.”</p>
        <p>“Which is…?”</p>
        <p>“Edge of town. Hold on and trust Karma to keep her busy.”</p>
        <p>Outside the car, Karma was trailing close behind, gait steady and effortless. He kept his field of vision focused forwards in the direction he was going, not turning his head despite his pursuer. Abyss charged forward, sensing an opening, leaping at him with her claws out as she drew close, only to find herself being grabbed mid-jump. He took her momentum and redirected it downwards, flinging her onto the road. From there he tried to jump over her and continue chasing, only to find his leg in a hold that sent him careening to the ground as well, both of them skidding down the road in the car’s wake.</p>
        <p>Seeing the fight between Karma Units, the officers guarding the apartments lining the street suddenly snapped to attention. Some trigger-happy ones fired at the pair, bullets wedging into their armour but failing to cause any appreciable damage. Others reached for their radios to report the scene.</p>
        <p>“Ah, shit,” Karma said with unfitting calm, focus darting between the officers radioing in. He rolled onto his back and crunched his stomach to look at Abyss as she worked to sink her claws into his leg. With his free foot he clawed at her, ineffectual at getting her to let go but more than sufficient to keep her from noticing his arm starting to peel open once more. The inner mechanics churned, this time producing not a gun, but a sabre. With one clean swing, he bought it down, slicing off his own leg and kicking Abyss away.</p>
        <p>“Ugh, you snake!” Abyss let go of the remains of Karma’s leg, not expecting such an act in the least. The metal suddenly lost its form, dissolving into a black sludge that began to creep across the asphalt back towards him. She didn’t allow her start to keep her down for long, flipping up to her feet and charging forwards towards Karma. In her anger, however, she neglected that he was still armed with the self-same sabre he’d just used to slice clean through his own leg. It sliced through her own legs with equal ease, and before she even fell to the ground, he grabbed one of them and threw it down the street with all his strength, out of sight.</p>
        <p>“I’m modelled after a cat, actually!” Karma not so helpfully corrected as the sludge that had been his leg drew close. With his good leg, he dug his talons into Abyss and tossed her to the side of the road, shimmying his stump in close to the sludge. It suddenly shifted from its slow approach to something rapid and deliberate the moment it made contact, swiftly reforming into the leg it had been not long before.</p>
        <p>“I don’t give a shit what you are!” Abyss screeched at him. Her leg that wasn’t thrown away reattached itself much as Karma’s did, but that still left her stuck on the ground. Undeterred, she raised her arm and opened up its plates, ready to produce her own weapon, only to find her whole body begin to shimmer and ripple as its metal shifted towards her missing leg instead. It happened swiftly, but still left her open for some few precious seconds. As she was busy mentally cursing her body for betraying her, Karma swung down and sliced off her outstretched arm, swiftly grabbing it and flinging it away in yet another random direction before sprinting off after the car.</p>
        <p>“It’s quite important to me personally!” he called back as he vanished down the street, callous to how pathetically Abyss was crawling after him.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t long at all before he caught back up with the car, casually drawing to heel by the driver’s side window to give Thao a wave and a thumbs up. Thao returned the gesture, quickly returning their focus to the road in front of them. In absence of their stubborn pursuer, the officers around found little unusual about the sight. It made for a quiet drive, in stark contrast to the chaos of the pursuit. There was no radio, just the sound of the engine, Karma’s feet upon the ground, and the pre-recorded announcements from Desiderius asking people to stay inside. Johanka kept her eyes on the rear-view camera feed. Without any chance to ask Karma what had happened, she was convinced that at any moment she would see a black blur appear on the screen.</p>
        <p>The edge of town was a stark enough thing on the best of days. On one side was a carefully curated ring of identical homes, with amenities and transport options perfectly placed to maximise efficiency. It was bright and colourful, and welcoming in a soulless way – the only character individual buildings were allowed being in what precise array of ads were plastered over the walls. On the other side of a perfectly-curated hedge fence garden dotted with watchtowers, was a sea of weathered tents and dilapidated buildings.</p>
        <p>Thao pulled the car into park and took a deep breath. They looked over to Johanka in the seat beside them, gripping the seatbelt hard enough it turned her knuckles white. She noticed, and looked up to meet their gaze.</p>
        <p>“Are we safe?” she asked softly.</p>
        <p>“Almost,” Thao said, turning to look towards the hedge. “We have a ship to get off-planet waiting out there, just have to get there and we’re home free.”</p>
        <p>A loud series of thumps sounded from the door – Karma was knocking. “Hey, ah, perhaps we should get to the ship before we celebrate?” he said, pointing back down the street with a jab of his thumb. Thao and Johanka craned their necks around the backs of their seats to look.</p>
        <p>She was now notably less than two metres of hazy black metal, the form of her armour somehow indestinct at the edges. All her limbs were thinner, and shorter, not matching the size of her torso at all. Despite her diminished state, she marched forwards undaunted. Abyss had not been stopped.</p>
        <p>“<i><b>Y</b>ou!</i>” she roared, pointing a shaking finger half-way between Karma and the car. The synthesiser of her voice was warped and warbled as it struggled even with the single word.</p>
        <p>Thao revved the car’s engine as they prepared to go. “The fuck did you do to her, man!?”</p>
        <p>“Cut off a leg, cut off an arm,” Karma replied, hastily looking back and forth between Abyss and Thao. “Was quite hoping that would be enough to get her to back off…”</p>
        <p>“S’all good, big guy, still got plan number A!” With that, they floored it, sending the car careening down the street. Karma bolted off alongside them, sparing a glance behind to see Abyss lurching forwards after them to best of her ability.</p>
        <p>“Hold on, you <i>cut off</i> her arm?” Johanka yelled over Thao towards Karma. “You can <i>regrow arms</i>!? You’re a robot!”</p>
        <p>“Well we wouldn’t be very useful on the field if we had to go back and be repaired for every minor scratch!”</p>
        <p>“That is <i>not</i> a minor scratch!”</p>
        <p>“Shut up and hold on!” Thao shouted over the both of them. They yanked the steering wheel to the right, swerving directly towards the hedge separating the town from the slums. The warning came too late for Johanka, who got slammed into the passenger side door. Karma’s limbs flailed about as he scrambled to change direction to avoid running into the car, an effort that was ultimately successful, but not without a brief slide on his arse along the asphalt. He swiftly scampered back to his feet, just in time to see the car go flying up the curb of the garden and straight through the hedge wall dividing the town from the slums. </p>
        <p>The road on the other side was far from smooth, and was in fact almost more pothole than asphalt. Each bump and jitter rattled the car, making a terrible noise as it struggled along. Curious heads poked out from the tents and crumbling walls to see what the racket was, and it wasn’t long before the settlement was abuzz with screams alerting each other of the arrival of K.A.P.. Thao struggled enough with the broken road, but with all the commotion now around them they very swiftly crashed the car straight into the corner of one of the ruins.</p>
        <p>“Woopsie,” Thao said with a bashful grin. A few bricks dislodged from the crumbling building and rained down upon the bonnet.</p>
        <p>Johanka shook off the shock of the impact and turned to glare at them. “Did any of you plan <i>any</i> of this?”</p>
        <p>“Stealing the kap car was improv!” Thao said, puffing out their chest proudly despite Johanka’s deepening scowl. “Pretty clever though, right? A kap car and a Karma Unit are a natural pairing!”</p>
        <p>Caught up in their unwelcome glee at their own plan, Thao failed to notice the looming shadow approaching the driver-side window until it unceremoniously yanked the door open. They froze, and turned to look, only to let out a sigh of relief as they realised it was just Karma.</p>
        <p>“Don’t sneak up on me like that, man!”</p>
        <p>Karma reached in and gently sliced through the top strap of their seatbelt with a single finger. “Both of you get out, we have to hide <i>now</i>.”</p>
        <p>“Is she really this scary, big guy? She’s pretty beat up, I bet you can take her,” Thao chuckled.</p>
        <p>“Not from <i>Abyss</i>,” Karma said as he cut off the rest of the belt, “from who she <i>answers to</i>.”</p>
        <p>Johanka went pale, and Thao froze, before both of them rapidly snapped into action and leaped out of the car. Johanka took a moment to look behind them, to see that Abyss was indeed still lurching on towards them. The sea of shouting and faces that had been all about not even a minute prior was gone, replaced with an unearthly silence broken only by the sound of Abyss’ struggling steps.</p>
        <p>“C’mon!” Thao said, grabbing Johanka’s wrist. Their fuzzy grip was enough to bring her out of her stupor and back to needing to hide. Karma rushed forwards, directly at the building the car was crashed into, and slammed straight through the damaged wall. A further shower of bricks came down, setting off the car’s alarm, but when the dust settled there was just enough of a hole for the other two to climb through and take shelter in the building. A family of three cowered inside, a woman holding a gun up at Karma with trembling hands while their son cowered behind her with a man.</p>
        <p>“I wouldn’t,” Karma said nonplussed as he hunched down in the corner by a window. “It won’t do anything.”</p>
        <p>“He’s with us, not them!” Thao hurriedly added as they shuffled up next to him. “Please, just stay calm.”</p>
        <p>All Johanka had to offer was an uncertain wave as she joined the group’s little huddle. Outside, Abyss had just reached the car, letting her body slump against the boot.</p>
        <p>“<b>Do</b> yo<i>u</i> think I di<i>dn</i>’t s<b>ee</b> y<b>o</b>u h<ins>id</ins><i>ing th</i>ere?” she called out with her still-broken voice towards the window. “<ins>Y<b>o</ins>u</b> c<i>ou</i>ld <i>h</i><b>av</b><i>e</i> r<ins>un</ins>, b<b>u</b>t i<ins>nst<i>e</ins>a</i>d <ins>y</ins>ou <i>let</i> <b>me</b> ha<ins>ve</ins> t<b>hi</b>s <i>lit</i>tle <i>s<ins>n<b>a</ins>c</b>k</i> b<i>e</i><ins>for</ins>e <b>I</b> k<ins>i</ins>ll <i>y</i>ou!”</p>
        <p>As she leaned against the car, her body began to sink into it. The metal she was made of rippled and flowed, steadily beginning to form its distinct shapes once more. Her armour smoothed out, her arms and legs regained their length, but she pulled herself away from he hole she had eaten into the car’s metal before her entire bulk had returned. Much like Karma earlier, she raised her arm up and opened its armour plating, managing to use some of the mass she had just regained to create a small rifle. She approached the building.</p>
        <p>“<i>Abyss</i>!” called a voice from down the street. Abyss froze, and turned to face the new arrival.</p>
        <p>She was two and a bit meters of stark white metal. Elegant plates of stocky build made up her form, clad with delicate filigree trim. Despite the decoration elsewhere, her face was as blank as any other Karma Unit, and her claws equally sharp. She walked forwards calmly and slowly on bulky, bestial legs much closer to Karma’s than Abyss’, though she lacked his tail. Her approach alone was enough to make Abyss absorb her gun back into her arm.</p>
        <p>“Samsara!” Abyss said, her voice shaking now due to who was in front of her, rather than being on the verge of breaking.</p>
        <p>“What are you doing out here?” Samsara asked as she continued her steady approach. She stopped uncomfortably close to Abyss, making the six or so centimetres between the two feel like much, much more.</p>
        <p>“I found a rogue Karma Unit, ma’am!”</p>
        <p>“Funny, so have I.” Samsara grasped Abyss’ shoulder and dug her claws in through her armour, causing the smaller unit to wince. “All units are known and accounted for. You are damaged, have abandoned the operation, <i>ate company property</i>…” She waved towards the damaged car with her free hand.</p>
        <p>“It was stolen!” Abyss said, looking frantically towards the window where she knew the trio were hiding. “They’re just-”</p>
        <p>“You can explain yourself to Desiderius,” Samsara interrupted Abyss’ desperate attempt to justify her actions. “We’re leaving. Now. And you’re off duty for the foreseeable future.”</p>
        <p>Abyss looked over her shoulder, towards the window. “But ma’am-”</p>
        <p>Samsara’s grip tightened, the metal of Abyss’ shoulder crunching uncomfortably in her grip. “The more you argue, the more Andromeda charges Desiderius for letting his Karma Units out of the area she gave him permission to deploy them in. Do you want to explain <i>that</i> to him?”</p>
        <p>Those words took any wind Abyss had left out from her sails. She slumped, and looked back towards Samsara. “Fine, point made, I’ll tell him <i>myself</i>. Let’s go.”</p>
        <p>Samsara’s hand remained firmly lodged in Abyss’ plating as she led the other Karma Unit away.  Abyss dragged her feet as she walked, looking back over her shoulder one last time before Samsara got fed up with her petulance and hoisted her over her shoulder. In a flash, she bolted off, leaving the slums to sit with their terrified silence.</p>
        <p>The trio sat frozen under the window, and the family trembling in the corner. Reality felt somehow fragile, as if slight move would shatter the illusion of safety and bring Samsara back with claws bared. But time ticked on, the clouds shifted lazily across the purple sky, and there remained no sign of her return. It was the family’s son who moved first, wriggling free of his father’s arms to approach Karma cautiously. He looked down at the child and cocked his head, observing as he was observed. Everyone around them watched as Karma flicked his tail towards the boy and gently swished it about.</p>
        <p>“You’re really big,” the boy said, and just like that, the layer of uncertainty scattered to the wind. Everyone else began to move, though each group both kept to their own corners.</p>
        <p>“I don’t know if that was more or less scary than if Desiderius himself had shown up,” Thao said with a sigh, letting their weight sink into Karma. </p>
        <p>“I had no idea they came in <i>white</i>,” was Johanka’s statement on the matter. She chose to lean against the wall instead of Karma.</p>
        <p>“Samsara is special,” Karma said as he watched the boy play with his tail, “she’s Desiderius’ <i>personal</i> Karma Unit.”</p>
        <p>“So he sent her instead of Nisha, then?” Thao said. “Guess she’s busy.”</p>
        <p>“Who <i>are</i> you people?”</p>
        <p>The three looked back up at the couple huddling in the opposite corner, looking nervously at their son blissfully playing with a Karma Unit. Thao looked at Karma, then to Johanka, then to the couple offered a big thumbs up and a cheerful grin.</p>
        <p>“We’re gonna take down the Plutocracy!” they said.</p>
        <p>The couple looked towards each other, the father called over their son. They bought him into the huddle even as the boy looked sadly back towards his new friend. Sure that her son was safe, the woman pulled out her gun once more and pointed it towards the trio.</p>
        <p>“Get away from us,” she said, voice trembling. Thao opened their mouth, ready to protest, only for Karma to quietly rise to his feet and clamber out through the hole in the wall he had made. As he did, Johanka grabbed Thao’s wrist, and dragged them out as well.</p>
        <p>“You can’t just say shit like that,” she hissed in their ear. “You’ll get people killed.”</p>
        <p>“Especially on an Andromeda planet,” Karma added, “even her slums are bugged.”</p>
        <p>Thao winced and looked away at the ground. “...Let’s get back to the ship,” they mumbled, leading the way to whence they had landed.</p>
        <p>The ship awaited them on the edge of the slums, a stunningly sleek thing surrounded by gawking children clothed in mismatched uniforms of varying sizes too large. The sound of their laughter staggered to a halt as the trio came into view, eyes immediately drawn to both the towering Karma Unit and Johanka’s uniform. Many of them scattered away as they approached, vanishing into the dilapidated buildings and tents. Some brave souls, or those too scared to move, stayed and watched as the three slipped away into the stars.</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">--------------------------</p>
        <p>The weight of everything that happened sunk down into Johanka’s chest as she was ferried to parts unknown. She had experienced spaceflight before, but only upon being abruptly reassigned to new projects on new planets. Those ships had felt more akin to cattle transport than anything else, all brutally efficient and uncaring for aesthetics as she was shuttled along with people who were soon to be her coworkers. This ship, in comparison, felt as if it was all about the aesthetic, with sleek white walls, colourful lights, and even a private bathroom with localised gravity. It was far, far nicer than any ship she had ever dreamed of being on, which raised enough questions on its own. As she looked at Karma casually floating weightless around the lounge, however, there was one question that she could not get out of her mind.</p>
        <p>It took her six minutes of watching him drift about, gently bumping into the walls, before she finally willed herself to ask it. “Earlier,” she said tentatively, “when Thao said you plan to take down the Plutocracy… did he mean it?”</p>
        <p>“They,” Karma corrected, grabbing on to a nearby handrail to stop himself from drifting about. “And, well, that’s the goal.”</p>
        <p>“Do you think it’s possible?”</p>
        <p>Karma cocked his head and flicked his tail. “Who knows,” he said, “lots of people have tried. These days Desiderius gets most of them. Before him, it was Sigihild, and so on and so on.” He let go of the handrail and rolled over, catching himself and stopping the spin by hooking his foot on it instead. “What do you think?”</p>
        <p>Johanka rolled the question around in her mind. Long had she looked up bitterly at those who owned her and dreamed of clawing from them her fair share. Money enough to chose where she went, where she lived, who she worked for. Not even anything so grand and righteous as changing it all for the better, just a selfish little dream of her and a few friends getting more than a crumb of a crumb. Then, of course, when she dared try, it wound up with her here, talking with a Karma Unit headed to parts unknown as the sole survivor.</p>
        <p>The door slid open with a hiss before she could get her thoughts in order. Thao took a second to spin themselves on the doorframe to reorient themselves so up was roughly in line with Johanka’s before they spoke. “We’re here!” they announced proudly. “Safe and sound with only one explicitly welcomed Karma Unit in sight!”</p>
        <p>Karma gently unhooked himself from the handrail and pushed towards the door. “Well, come on then,” he said, waving Johanka over, “let’s get you settled in shall we?”</p>
        <p>The whole place was carved from stone. The roof was curved and made of natural shapes, the walls were smooth and polished, while the floors bore scuff marks matching Karma’s talons. According to Thao’s excited babbling, the whole place was carved out of an asteroid and was completely off-grid, with a grav-gen installed for comfort. Much of the details went over her head as she was marched down a chillingly utilitarian hallway leading out of the hangar. There was no decorations on the walls bar a steady row of lights and the doors at either end. Even were there decorations, however, she had the hunch they would not be enough to distract her from the mass of metal trotting along behind her. As trustworthy as he had proven so far, it was still hard to ignore what he represented.</p>
        <p>The utilitarian hallway lead into an equally utilitarian space that could hardly even be called a room. It felt more akin to stepping into a lightly upgraded cave than a building. The walls were rough-hewn stone that curved into a jagged ceiling, a few hanging lights dangling from above to illuminate the space. In contrast however the floor was thankfully smooth, though Karma had left obvious paths of scratches along his favoured paths. There was a small but elegant kitchenette, complete with oven, stove, sizeable fridge and a collection of appliances that Johanka could only half name. A small dining space had been set up next to it out of a wooden table, some lawn chairs, and for some reason a tall metal crate. On the other side of the room, in a nook formed by the shape of the cavern, was a large computer set-up, half a whorl of chaos and half almost uncannily neat.</p>
        <p>“Welcome back, everyone. Mission successful, I see?”</p>
        <p>Emerging from the much neater half of the mass of computers was a man with a curtain of silken platinum hair that reached down to his knees. His face was nigh-flawless, like that of some sort of fae, and his stark pale eyes seemed to stare into one’s soul. Despite his pleading for professionalism, he was wearing a graphic tee, cargo shorts, and thongs over mismatched socks.</p>
        <p>“You bet!” Thao said with a thumbs up. “Come introduce yourself to the new girl!”</p>
        <p>He walked over with impeccable grace, almost seeming to float, offering his hand for a shake when he arrived. “Santeri. Provisioning and logistics specialist. A pleasure to meet you, Johanka.”</p>
        <p>Johanka looked down at his outstretched, immaculate hand, taking in the delicate fingers for a moment before accepting the handshake. “S-same here.”</p>
        <p>As Santeri stepped back after the handshake, Johanka looked around in preparation for the next member to eagerly approach. The computer corner from which Thao and Santeri had emerged sat empty, but not quite quiet thanks to tinny pop music coming from someone’s speakers. The kitchenette sat untended, utensils packed away and the appliances all firmly switched off. As her eyes drifted towards the makeshift dining area, she suddenly realised – minus the crate, there were only three chairs.</p>
        <p>“Is this…” she spoke softly, not sure she wanted to hear the answer to her suspicion. “Is this a three-man operation?”</p>
        <p>“Not quite,” Santeri said, “our leader is currently busy. She’ll be by soon enough though, once she’d free from work.”</p>
        <p>“Our little secret weapon!” Karma said, puffing out his chest proudly.</p>
        <p>“Who is she?”</p>
        <p>“Who is she?” Karma repeated after her as he stepped around from behind Johanka into the main space. Somehow, he let out a laugh, a strange garbled noise with his mechanical voice. “Who could requisition a faulty Karma unit!” he said, gesturing at himself with a dramatic flair and bow. “Who could keep us hidden from the Plutocrats after a show like that!” A spin, followed by a wide open two-handed wave towards the space of the hideout. “Who could find us a place like this! The one, the only, Nisha Desiderius!”</p>
        <p>“<i>Nisha!?</i>” Johanka gasped. “Desiderius’ right hand woman!? <i>That</i> Nisha!?”</p>
        <p>Karma dropped his arms to his side. “Well, uh, yes. How many people named Nisha do you think Desiderius has working for him…?”</p>
        <p>Thao laughed, giving Johanka a gentle pat on her shoulder as they walked forwards into the room as well. “Come on, how about we get you something to eat? Santeri makes the <i>best</i> muffins.”</p>
        <p>Karma was dashing to the kitchenette to open up the muffin jar before Thao even finished mentioning them. “Yeah! You made me throw the last one on the ground so now you have to eat <i>two!</i>”</p>
        <p>Santeri rolled his eyes. “He’s just jealous he can’t eat them,” he whispered as he walked over to join the forming group in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>Many things had happened that day that Johanka could not have possibly predicted. The raid, the rescue, being roped into whatever this group was. The muffins were, as promised, quite tasty, but as she sat down and ate, surrounded by the banter of people who knew each other quite well, she found it all bubbling over out into unstoppable sobbing. On and on she went, barely aware of everyone quietly watching her, until all her exhaustion hit at once and she drifted off to sleep.</p>
